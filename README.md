# Smixer

Smixer is a minecraft mod that should be used together with
the [SkyblockAddons Mod by Biscuit](https://github.com/BiscuitDevelopment/SkyblockAddons). Sadly SBA is End-Of-Life and
no longer receives updates, therefore this mod exists. It fixes a lot of its bugs by using so-called "Mixins".

## Why did I choose the name "Smixer"?

Well that's a boring story. I first thought of naming it "SBAMixer", as it's a Mixin-Mod for SBA but this looked ugly in
the package names. So I just went with Smixer.

# Usage

To use this mod, first install the newest version (`v1.7.2` as of writing this) of SBA from their GitHub. Then
additionally install this mod alongside it, you should now see how many bugs "magically" disappear.
