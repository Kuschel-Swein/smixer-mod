# Smixer

Smixer is a minecraft mod that should be used together with
the [SkyblockAddons Mod by Biscuit](https://github.com/BiscuitDevelopment/SkyblockAddons). Sadly SBA is End-Of-Life and
no longer receives updates, therefore this mod exists. It fixes a lot of its bugs by using so-called "Mixins".
<br>
**A word of warning:** As this mod is in a very early stage crashes are very likely to happen, please report them in an
issue!

## Why did I choose the name "Smixer"?

Well that's a boring story. I first thought of naming it "SBAMixer", as it's a Mixin-Mod for SBA but this looked ugly in
the package names. So I just went with Smixer.

# Usage

To use this mod, first install the newest version (`v1.7.2` as of writing this) of SBA from their GitHub. Then
additionally install this mod alongside it, you should now see how many bugs "magically" disappear.

Please note, that currently the only fully supported language is english, feel free to contribute any other
translations.

# Found a bug in either sba or this mod?

If you think you found a bug, please let me know via an issue.

# Building it yourself

To build this mod yourself you have to do the usual gradle shenanigans. Additionally, you have to download the newest
version (`v1.7.2` as of writing this) of SBA from their GitHub and place it in the `libs` folder. The name of this file
is hard-coded in the build-script.
